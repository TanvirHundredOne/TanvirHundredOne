* The risk score is calculated and updated periodically while real-time system detects device change real-time which can be vulnerable times for frauds.
* Developed with C++ this lightweight system mimics the cycling technique `slipstream` to stay behind app to monitor user beghaviour.
* The system does not store historical data or learn from them which ensures user privacy as well.
