<!-- Hello, This is Tanvir.  -->

<!-- **Tanvir, ML Engineer and Enthusiast** -->
**Welcome**
to my personal website! I’m Hasan Tanvir Iqbal. I completed my bachelor's in CS from <a href='http://www.iutoic-dhaka.edu/'>IUT</a>. I have been working as an ML engineer at Bangladesh’s largest fintech company, <a href='https://www.bkash.com/en'>bKash Company Ltd.</a> As an AI professional, I have worked on developing impactful solutions that have impacted millions of lives. Continuous learning and sharing your own findings are the simplest ways to continuously grow as a human and professional.

**What I am currently working on:**

*4 May, 2024*

__*How do you predict something that is very volatile in nature ?*__

In my first year at bKash, I worked on time-series forecasting. Mainly predicting transaction counts on a daily or hourly basis, based on location, different types of transactions, etc. Now I was told to replicate the forecasting for amounts on a daily basis. But the issue is that amounts are as volatile as time series, which can vary by billions per day. I was scrathing my head to solve something that was supposed to be very straight-forward work.

**Personal Work**

As any other professional in the field of AI, I am facinated by LLMs right now. I have been looking into its small scale usability. I am also collaborating with multiple researchers under <a href='https://aisafety.camp/'>AISC</a> on creating safer LLM.

**Beyond Tech Stuff**

I believe my spirit animal is the sloth. I like to watch football or TV shows while relaxing in my bed.

**Educational Journey:**

My adventure into the world of technology began with my pursuit of a Computer Science degree, equipped with a solid foundation in software development, algorithms, and problem-solving. My love for learning was ignited during this academic journey, and I've carried it with me throughout my professional career.

**Machine Learning Enthusiast:**

After completing my formal education, I embarked on a journey to explore the endless possibilities of machine learning. I was drawn to its potential to transform industries and make a profound impact on our daily lives. As a Machine Learning Engineer, I've had the privilege of working on a diverse range of projects, from natural language processing and computer vision to recommendation systems and predictive analytics.

My daily work involves turning complex data into actionable insights and building models that drive intelligent decision-making. I'm dedicated to staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field, which allows me to deliver cutting-edge solutions to the challenges I encounter.
